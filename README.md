Greetings, a Lua Filter Template
==================================================================

[![GitHub build status][CI badge]][CI workflow]

Greetings is a friendly Lua filter that adds a welcoming message
to the document.

This repository serves as a template intended to make publishing
of pandoc [Lua filters][] easy and convenient. Just click "use
this template" and then make modifications in your new repository.
See also the GitHub documentation on [creating a repository from a
template][from template].

Checklist
------------------------------------------------------------------

This is just a template, so a few things should be changed to make
good use of this template. You can use the checklist below to
ensure that you get the most out of it. We recommend that you
perform at least the first two steps, everything else is up to
you.

1. [ ] **Rename the filter**: rename the filter `greetings.lua` to
   your chosen name. It's often a good idea to make the filter
   name match the repository name: if your repository is named
   `lorem`, then the filter should be named `lorem.lua`.

2. [ ] **Update the license**: The template is published under the
   MIT, and we recommend to keep the same license for your code.
   You should update the LICENSE file so it has your name.

3. [ ] **Update this README**: Describe your filter, so people
   will know what to expect. You may also want to update the URLs
   in the links above to match your repository.

4. [ ] (optional) **Setup Quarto extension**: This step is
   recommended if you want to make it easy for [Quarto][] users to
   install and use your filter: Quarto expects the filter to be
   placed in the `_extensions` folder, packed together with a YAML
   file containing relevant metadata. Run

   ``` bash
   make quarto-extension
   ```

   to generate the necessary files and directories. You should
   commit the generated files to source control. See also the
   [`quarto-extension` documentation](quarto-extension) below.

5. [ ] (optional) **Tag a release**: The easiest way to create a
   new release is to run `make release VERSION=0.0.1`. This will
   update the Quarto extension, commit the changes, then tag the
   resulting commit with the given VERSION. This step is
   recommended if the filter is distributed as a Quarto extension.

Development
------------------------------------------------------------------

The repository comes with a `Makefile` intended to make developing
a filter a pleasant experience. You may want to adjust some of the
targets while keeping the general structure.

Use the Makefile with `make ...`, where `...` denotes one of the
targets listed in this section.

### `test`

Tests the filter. This target runs your filter on file
`test/input.md` and compares the result with
`test/expected.native`. The latter file is also a valid make
target; invoke it to regenerate the expected output.

You may want to modify this target if your filter is intended for
a specific output format. E.g., if the filter only works for HTML
output, you may choose to replace `test/expected.native` with
`test/expected.html`, and to compare that file instead.

### `quarto-extension`

This target sets the repository up to be used as a [Quarto][]
extension. The target will create the directory structure expected
by quarto. It will also generate a `_extension.yml` metadata file.
Invoking this target will move the main `.lua` file below the
`_extensions` directory; the the original file will be replaced
with a symlink.

[Quarto]: https://quarto.org

### `release`

Creates a new release for the given version. The version must be
passed as a variable:

``` bash
make release VERSION=1.0.0
```

The `release` target depends on `quarto-extension`.

### `website`

Generates a website for this filter. The website will contain the
contents of this README, an example generated from the test input,
as well as the full filter code. The page components are combined
with the `.tools/docs.lua` filter.

Website
------------------------------------------------------------------

The repository template comes with a GitHub Action to publish a
website via GitHub pages. It expects the new "GitHub Actions"
source to be used for Pages.

Remove the file `.github/workflows/website.lua` to disable this
feature.
